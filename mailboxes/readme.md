## Project 1: Frogger

The idea of Frogger is to guide a family of frogs across a road, and a river to their homes at the top of the screen.
To make things more challenging there are numerous moving obstacles that the frogs must avoid to reach their destination.

In order to do it we were also provided of a Readme for the instructions, a link to a possible layout and two links to a Wikipedia entry and a demonstrative Youtube video
